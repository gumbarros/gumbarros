## Hello there üê¢

I'm a Tech Lead at [JJConsulting](https://www.github.com/jjconsulting). I love coding, software architecture, and enjoy working within the .NET ecosystem. I'm a Linux user and a big fan of open source. Always exploring new tools and pushing for simplicity in everything I build.

Some of the projects I work:
#### [JJMasterData](https://www.github.com/jjconsulting/JJMasterData) 
JJMasterData is a runtime form generator based on database metadata. It allows you to create forms dynamically by leveraging information from your database schema.

#### [NCalc](https://www.github.com/ncalc/ncalc) 
NCalc is a powerful mathematical expression evaluator for .NET.

When not coding I like to touch grass, swim, play piano, travel and do human things.
