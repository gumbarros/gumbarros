## Hello there 

I currently work at [JJConsulting](https://www.github.com/jjconsulting). I like the .NET ecosystem and also Flutter sometimes. 

Some of the projects I work:
#### [JJMasterData](https://www.github.com/jjconsulting/JJMasterData) 
JJMasterData is a runtime form generator based on database metadata. It allows you to create forms dynamically by leveraging information from your database schema.

#### [NCalc](https://www.github.com/ncalc/ncalc) 
NCalc is a powerful mathematical expression evaluator for .NET.

When not coding I like to swim, play piano and travel.
